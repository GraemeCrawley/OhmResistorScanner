\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project }
The purpose of this project is to re-implement the open source package \href{https://github.com/sumeetkr/AndroidResistorScanner}{ "AndroidResistanceScanner" } by allowing a user to scan a standard resistor and output the resistance value to the screen, and then build upon that previously existing application by creating additional features and putting a greater emphasis on formal docuementation.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
The main stakeholders for this application are the development team and our eventual users. However there are a number of different use cases for this application, so we will divide our users into the broad demographics of electronics beginners, colorblind hobbyists, and power users. Beginners are people new to electronics who dont know how to read resistor color codes and dont yet own a resistance meter to allow for measuring resistance rather than reading it. Another group that has difficulty reading resistor color codes are colorblind hobbyists. This particular set of people would benefit greatly as without this application they would have to rely on the word from those who are not color blind, or from the matching of shades. Finally power users who want to quickly find a resistor without manually searching, possibly with other use cases.

\section{Project Constraints}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
Constraints for this project can be broken into two categories; developer constraints and device constraints. Developer contraints are constraints that pertain to the development of the application while device constraints are constraints that pertain to the user's device and what is required to use the application. 
\subsubsection{Developer Constraints}
Developer constraints consist of the due date for the application which is December 7, 2016, the requirement that the application must be a re-implementation of a previously existing application on both Android and Windows, and the requirement that the application must be built at no cost to the developers.
\subsubsection{Device Constraints}
Device constraints include constraints on the hardware of the device and the resistors being scanned. Hardware constraints include the system having a camera and the CPU being fast enough to run the required algorithms. The resistors must be tan in colour and placed on a  flat, uniformly coloured surface.

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Resistor: Beige coloured, axial lead resistor
\item Device: The hardware running the application software
\item User: Any person who is using the final product to scan resistors
\item AndroidResistorScanner: The name of the open-source resistor scanning program
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
It is assumed that the user knows the function of a resistor and understands how resistors are measured. It is also assumed that the user can see the text on the output screen. It is not assumed, however, that the user could read a resistor given a resistor chart.


\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work}

\subsubsection{The Current Situation}

Electronics hobbyists will use resistors in almost any project they encounter.
Currently there are a few ways they can identify the resistance of the resistors, these methods are as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item Manual Method
\subitem The resistor colour code was developed to allow the ease of reading for people. 
With practise, people can quickly identify resistors by the colour bands, however this is less helpful when searching  for a specific resistor.
Additionally building proficiency takes time and can be a frustrating slowdown for a beginner, especially if they misidentify components during assembly.

\item Organizational Method
\subitem By storing resistors according to their resistances it becomes a trivial exercise to find a resistor of a given resistance.
This method is clearly superior in professional environments where very large numbers of resistors are on hand.

\item Meter Method
\subitem The current technique of choice for individuals who cannot discern colour codes is to measure a given resistor with a resistance meter.
This technique is immediately faster than reading colour bands, however it is somewhat laborious to have to pick up and test individual components.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Context of The Work}

This work has a very limited context, it serves as a tool to any person using colour band resistors who feels it useful.
There are not other subject matter domains that need to be understood or integrated with, beyond the resistor colour codes.

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}

This work does not need to respond to any external business events, this section is not relevant

\subsection{The Scope of the Product}

\subsubsection{Product Boundary}
This project is a simple tool, with the user as the only actor.
As such the use case diagram is fairly minimal.

    \label{fig:use_case_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Product Use Case List}

As our products usability improves between phases of functionality, the use case will expand.
A use case for each phase is provided.

\textbf{ Phase 1 Use Case}

A user launches the app, and seeks to identify a specific resistor.
They hold the resistor up to the camera and aligns the primary axis resistor with an on screen line.
The system is constantly scanning, and once a coherent pattern of color bands is identified, the resistance is calculated and displayed.
Once the system can no longer identify a coherent pattern of color bands, the displayed resistance value dissappears, until a new resistor is identified.

\textbf{ Phase 2 Use Case}

A user launches the app, and seeks to identify a specific resistor.
The user points the camera in the general direction of the resistor, with little care for accurate framing.
The system is constantly scanning, and once a coherent pattern of color bands is identified, the resistance is calculated and displayed.
Once the system can no longer identify a coherent pattern of color bands, the displayed resistance value dissappears, until a new resistor is identified.

\textbf{ Phase 3 Use Case}

A user launches the app, and seeks to find a specific resistor in a group.
The user points the camera at the group of resistors.
The system is constantly scanning, and for any coherent pattern of color bands identified, the resistance is calculated and displayed in frame next to the resistor.
